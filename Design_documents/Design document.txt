Intro:

You awaken... You are lying down in some kind of cryochamber wearing nothing but long underwear and a thin shirt. You carefully get up and feel a soft sensation of cold air flowing on your skin. Around you see a mostly white room full of neon-blue metallic cryochambers arranged around a grayish central pillar. The walls look softly padded with white plates. Embedded on the walls are some bulky-looking computer screens. The other cryochambers are empty and their lids are raised. Maybe the others awoke before you?
